            <p>Continuing the Mission was founded out of a desire to give back to the Veteran community and a deep understanding of how dogs can significantly change lives. Our Board members consist of 5 Veterans who are all volunteers, have first hand knowledge of the circumstances soldiers face in today’s military, and can empathize with the challenges our soldiers face reintegrating into their communities after service. In addition, we have 3 Director Positions held by Veterans and Veteran spouses who are also all volunteers. We are all dog lovers working together to provide service dogs that change Veteran’s lives! CTM also recognizes that service dogs help not just their Veterans, but everyone in the family.</p> 
            <p>Continuing the Mission, Inc. is a North Carolina 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation run by Veterans and their families. Our mission is to train service dogs to empower Veterans to reintegrate after service.  Specifically, our focus is on providing service dogs to Veterans suffering from PTSD. These dogs are provided at no cost to the Veteran, with the exception of travel expenses incurred for training and pairing of the service dog with the Veteran. CTM continues to provide ongoing support and training to all Graduate Teams after pairing.</p>

            <p>Training is very important, but there will also be times when we need help giving our dogs a little extra TLC. Bathing, walking, and petting are ways you can help us shape our future service dogs into faithful companions. If you have time in your schedule and would like to help care for our service dogs in training, please let us know!</p>

            <p>Each Continuing the Mission event has many different facets in order to be successful. Many hands make light work, and there is a role for everyone. This is also a great way to see what goes on behind the scenes of providing a service dog. Think of it like having a Backstage Pass. Help us get our message out.</p>
