            <h2>Veteran Application</h2><hr>

            <p>Thank you for your interest in acquiring a PTSD Service Dog through Continuing the Mission (CTM).</p>

            <p>We are deeply committed to providing service dogs to veterans for the purpose of improving their lives
            through support. We pride ourselves on optimal veteran-service dog matches and, to that end, we have
            several criteria that must be met in order to be considered for placement.</p>

                <p><input type="checkbox" name="PTSD" value="PTSD"> Diagnosis of PTSD by a licensed Behavioral Health Provider</p>
                <p><input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="Bike"> Active treatment with a licensed Behavioral Health Provider for at least three months</p>
                <p><input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="Bike"> Commitment towards continued engagement in treatment for at least 6 months after pairing</p>
                <p><input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="Bike"> Ability to physically and financially care for a dog, and have resided at the same location for six months</p>
                <p><input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="Bike"> Ability to travel to Southern Pines, NC, for training and pairing with a service dog</p>



                <p>In addition to these requirements, we will conduct an assessment of your suitability to provide a stable
                home environment for your service dog. We strongly believe service dogs can be extremely beneficial
                for Veterans with PTSD, however they are not a substitute for continued behavioral health treatment.</p>

                <p>You are ineligible for a service dog through CTM if you have been hospitalized for mental health
                reasons within the last 6 months, carry a diagnosis of psychosis, delusions, dementia, or have active
                alcohol/substance dependence. Additionally, active suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, history of
                aggressive or violent behaviors, or cognitive disabilities that would preclude safety of the service dog
                are also considered as disqualifying.</p>

                <p>Our PTSD service dogs are trained to perform the following: blocking (standing in between you and
                other people in a non-threatening manner), turning on a light, picking up an object, and sweeping an
                empty house for intruders.</p>

                <p>After reviewing the criteria, please let us know if you would like to begin the evaluation process by
                contacting us at ContinuingtheMission.org. Please note that If you are currently ineligible (i.e. not in
                treatment, havenâ€™t lived in the same residence for 6 months, etc.), you may become eligible if your
                circumstances change, and are welcome to reapply at that time.</p>
