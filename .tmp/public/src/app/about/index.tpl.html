            <h2 style="color:black">Training</h2>
            <p>Training is very important, but there will also be times when we need help giving our dogs a little extra TLC. Bathing, walking, and petting are ways you can help us shape our future service dogs into faithful companions. If you have time in your schedule and would like to help care for our service dogs in training, please let us know!</p>

            <p>Each Continuing the Mission event has many different facets in order to be successful. Many hands make light work, and there is a role for everyone. This is also a great way to see what goes on behind the scenes of providing a service dog. Think of it like having a Backstage Pass. Help us get our message out.</p>
